# SmallSamples
Explore small sample corrections for common statistics

# SampleMean, SampleStandardDeviation and SampleVariance
Make small sample corrections to the uncertainty on the 
sample mean and the estimate of the standard deviation accounting 
for the remaining bias in the usual standard deviation estimate 
based on the unbiased variance estimate from the sample
